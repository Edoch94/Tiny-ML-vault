Region Proposal Networks (RPNs) are a type of neural network used in object detection tasks to generate object proposals, which are potential object bounding boxes that may contain an object of interest.

RPNs were introduced in the [[Faster R-CNN]] architecture, and they are typically used in conjunction with a convolutional neural network (CNN) to generate object proposals in an efficient and accurate way.

The RPN takes an image as input and generates a set of **anchor boxes**, which are predefined boxes of different scales and aspect ratios that cover different parts of the image. For each anchor box, the **RPN predicts a score that indicates the likelihood of an object being present inside that box**, as well as the coordinates of a bounding box that tightly encloses the object.

The output of the RPN is then used to select a subset of the anchor boxes with the highest scores and **pass them to a subsequent detection network for further processing**, such as classification and refinement of the object boundaries.

By using an RPN to generate object proposals, the Faster R-CNN architecture achieves state-of-the-art performance in object detection tasks with improved speed and accuracy compared to previous methods.
