Cascade Label Guidance (CLG) is a training strategy for deep neural networks that is used for object detection and other similar tasks. The CLG approach **involves training the network in a cascade fashion**, with **each stage** of the network learning to **detect a specific subset of object classes**.

In a typical object detection task, the goal is to detect and localize multiple objects of different classes in an image. In the CLG approach, the training process is divided into multiple stages, with <u>each stage focusing on a specific subset of the object classes</u>. For example, in the first stage of the network, the model might be trained to detect and localize only the most common object classes in the dataset, such as people or cars. In the second stage, the model might be trained to detect and localize less common object classes, such as bicycles or traffic signs. This process can be repeated for multiple stages, with each stage focusing on **increasingly specific subsets of the object classes**.

The key idea behind the CLG approach is that by focusing on a specific subset of the object classes at each stage, the network can learn to **better distinguish between objects of different classes** and improve the overall detection accuracy. Additionally, the CLG approach can help to **reduce the number of false positive detections**, as the network is less likely to mistakenly detect objects that are not present in the image.

The CLG approach has been shown to be effective in <u>improving the accuracy of object detection models</u>, **particularly in scenarios** where the **object classes are highly imbalanced** or where the dataset contains many **rare or uncommon object classes**.
