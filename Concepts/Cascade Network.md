A cascade network is a type of neural network architecture that is designed to perform a **sequence of tasks** in a <u>hierarchical manner</u>. In a cascade network, **each stage** of the network is responsible for a **specific task**, and the output of each stage is passed as input to the next stage.

Cascade networks are often used for object detection and recognition tasks, where the goal is to detect objects in an image and classify them into different categories. The cascade network is typically composed of multiple stages, each of which is responsible for a different task. The **first stage** of the network is <u>usually a simpler, faster model</u> that is used to quickly <u>eliminate background</u> regions of the image that are unlikely to contain objects. The output of the first stage is then passed to the **second stage**, which is a more complex model that is used to perform a <u>more detailed analysis of the image</u>, focusing on the regions that are most likely to contain objects. This **process is repeated for multiple stages**, with each stage performing a more detailed analysis of the image and narrowing down the search space for the next stage.

Cascade networks can be composed of any type of neural network architecture, such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs) or recurrent neural networks (RNNs), depending on the specific task at hand. The main advantage of cascade networks is that they can be more efficient and accurate than a single-stage network, as each stage can focus on a specific task and the network can be optimized for each stage independently.

Cascade networks have been used in a wide range of applications, such as face detection, object recognition, and action recognition. They have achieved state-of-the-art performance in many of these tasks and are widely used in computer vision research and industry.
